This repository contains material related to Udacity's Pytorch Scholarship Challenge. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. <br><br>

Among several topics in this repository, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks and recurrent networks. <br><br>


Table of contents:
- 2-neural_net_intro (Introduction to Neural Networks): Introdutions code for neural networks. Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
- 4-intro-to-pytorch (Introduction to PyTorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.
- Sentiment Analysis with NumPy: Andrew Trask leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
