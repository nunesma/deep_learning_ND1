This repository contains material related to Udacity's Pytorch Scholarship Challenge. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. <br><br>

Among several topics in this repository, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks and recurrent networks. <br><br>


Table of contents:
- 2-neural_net_intro (Introduction to Neural Networks): Introdutions code for neural networks. Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
- 4-intro-to-pytorch (Introduction to PyTorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.
- 5-convolutional-neural-networks: Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying MNIST data, a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the CIFAR10 dataset.Convolutional Neural Networks: Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN.

- 6-style-transfer: Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!
- 7-recurrent-neural-networks: Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how tom implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.
- Sentiment Analysis with NumPy: Andrew Trask leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
