Your first neural network

Introduction


In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! 


By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how the gradient, backpropagation, and other important concepts work before we start using tools like Tensorflow. 


You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!


Data: Bike Sharing Dataset


The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
