### Neural_Network_intro
Enter neuro network notebooks as a Deep Learning experience


### CNN_mnist_classifier
deep learning nanodegree foundation Udacity's notebook


### P1: Your first neural network
In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how the gradient, backpropagation, and other important concepts work before we start using tools like Tensorflow. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!


### P2: Image Classification:
In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.


### P3: Generate TV Scripts
Crie suas pr칩prias redes recorrentes e redes LSTM (long short term memory - mem칩ria de longo e curto prazo) com Keras e TensorFlow; execute an치lises de sentimento e gere textos novos. Utilize redes recorrentes para gerar novos textos em roteiros para TV.


### P4: Make a translation chatbot
Build a chatbot that tranlates texts in real time. Chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. Chatbots often treat conversations like they're a game of tennis: talk, reply, talk, reply


### P5: Generate faces
Aprenda a interpretar e implementar o modelo de redes geradoras advers치rias convolucionais profundas para simular imagens realistas com Ian Goodfellow, o inventor das GANs.
