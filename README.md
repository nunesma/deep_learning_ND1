### Your first neural network

In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how the gradient, backpropagation, and other important concepts work before we start using tools like Tensorflow. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!
